                        HTML is the base language of the web. I use this language to create the basic format and text for any website that I create.

There is an option to bypass this and write plain English in a converter although I find it more stable to write clear and structured HTML instead.

                        CSS or Cascading Styling Sheet is the main language to style, colour and outline webpages. There are options to style within HTML although this breaks the best practice rule of separating concerns. By styling just in CSS, any change to the styles are done in this one language. Therefore, I use this as my main and only styling language.

                        Bootstrap is a CSS library that holds snippets and shortcuts for styling webpages.

                        SCSS is another library language for CSS. This language however is not accepted as a main source file and needs to be converted back into CSS before it can be used within a website. SCSS brings to the table the ability to create variables that can be reused throughout the code. It also has a better structure to help show the parent child relationship between the related elements. This language is very useful however the additional layer of converting can add an unnecessary step and I find this language is only useful while maintaining large CSS files.

                        JavaScript is the most widely used language for interactions within web development. I use this language for almost all interactions within my websites. I generally prefer to use vanilla JavaScript as it allows me greater control of interactions. Just like CSS there is a method to create JavaScript interaction within HTML however separating concerns helps with organisation and editing.

                        ReactJS is a JavaScript library that was created by Facebook. Its focus is to help create small and easily read files that link together. Its design is to try and fix the fact that JavaScript files can get very large and make it increasingly difficult to edit as the interactions grow. I have used this language to link together some basic interaction however I find it would be more useful when it is used for large projects.

                        jQuery is again another JavaScript library. Its purpose is to help with commonly used interactions so that an extensive knowledge of JavaScript is not needed. This can be very useful to create motion and clicking events. It also has a large documented structure so that most of its capabilities can be found rather easily. I have a knowledge of this library however I do prefer to create the interaction using vanilla JavaScript to allow greater control.

                        Adobe InDesign is a useful tool that complements both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. It’s main strength however is based on the multi-page layout that helps organise and display all work within one file. This application is vector based just like Adobe Illustrator, so it is not limited to pixels. It also can import work from both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator so that the main work can be done in those applications and the print/layout can be handled in this application.

                        3DS Max is a 3-dimensional modelling tool. Its strengths are based on the ability to create and develop 3-dimensional objects in a virtual space. This is useful as it provides the opportunity to recreate real life objects that can be controlled, moved and destroyed without doing it in real life. I have used this software to create replications of working engines and equipment for training purposes. I have also used its sister program 3DS Interactive which is a virtual reality scene developer to develop a virtual hanger with a solid H135 helicopter.

                        V-Ray is a software that works along with 3DS Max. Its main purpose is to provide a more realistic lighting system within the software. It does this with advance mathematics and by using V-Ray 3DS Max can render realistic and beautiful lighted scenes.

                        Unity is one of the largest gaming engines in the world. This software is designed to take in 3D models and scenes from software such as 3DS Max. It then uses software and scripts to control interactive scenes. This is generally used for games however it can be applied as a simulation application. I have used this software to create an interactive area as well as take advantage of its VR platform.

		<p class="experience">
			As seen above I have a wide range of skills. This is because the projects I have worked on
			require many different forms of media. I originally started as a 3D modeller. However
			I soon learned and applied my knowledge of the Adobe Suite to help within the 2D and video editing area of my job. Further to this there has always been a lack of code savy personnel within my roles. I decided to focus on this area further and now it is one of my most 
			strongest skills.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="experience">
			I have worked primarily on security cleared projects for the last 7 and a half years. Unfortuntly this means I don't have a wide range of examples to show as all work that I do
			has Security Cleared tags.
		</p>

		<p class="experience">
			Please find below a few examples of work that I completed for my own personal projects. I have also provide a link to my full CV as well as my wedding website which I created. Please take a look.
