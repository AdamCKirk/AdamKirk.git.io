			<h2 id="Coding-Skills">Coding Skills</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<h3>HTML5</h3><br>
					<p>
						I mainly use HTML to input information into websites. It is the base for all
						websites that I create. I mainly use this type of skill for work alongside
						the Kanexa tool.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>CSS</h3><br>
					<p>
						I use CSS to style the contents of webpages. Without the use of a CSS file any html page would appear black and white but mainly very dull.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>JavaScript</h3><br>
					<p>
						JavaScript is a massive language and there are many libraries which provides even more variaties. I use vanilla JavaScript to help program interactions and movements within websites.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<h3>C#</h3><br>
					<p>
						I learned C# as it is the primary lanuage for Unity. So far I have only ever used it within that software.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>Bootstrap</h3><br>
					<p>
						Bootstrap is a very useful tool to help build and develop websites with limited knowledge. The templates make it easy to style and animate without the knowledge of other software. This language is very well document which makes it easy to use.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>CreateJS</h3><br>
					<p>
						CreateJS is the language that I use within Adobe Animate. This is a library for the JavaScript lanuage built to work within the software. I use this as the main tool to create control and interaction. 
					</p>

			<h2 id="Design-Skills">Development Skills</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column">
					<h3>Adobe Suite</h3><br>
					<p>
						I have a broad knowledge of myany of the Adobe Suite packages. I mainly focus on Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate, After Effects and Dreamweaver. I mainly use this software to alter images, design illustration, alter videos, create interactive media and write code.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>3D Studio Max</h3><br>
					<p>
						This is a 3D software which allows the creation of 3D assets. I also use it to create rigs that allow movement of the 3D models.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>Unity</h3><br>
					<p>
						Unity is a software that allows the importation of models and code to create interactive assets. It is a very dynamic and useful tool that has many applications but is primarily used for games development.

	<div id="Experience" >
		<center>
			<h2>Experience</h2><br>
		</center>
		<p class="experience">
			As seen above I have a wide range of skills. This is because the projects I have worked on
			require many different forms of media. I originally started as just a 3D modeller. However
			I soon learned an applied my knowledge of the Adobe Suite to help within the 2D and video editing area of my job. Further to this there has always been a lack of code savy peronel within my roles. I decided to focus on this area further and now it is one of my most 
			strongest skills.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="experience">
			I have worked primarily on security cleared projects for the last 7 and a half years. Unfortuntly this means I don't have a wide range of examples to show as all work that I do
			has Security Cleared tags.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="experience">
			Please find below a few examples of work that I completed for my own personal projects. I have also provide a link to my full CV as well as my wedding website which I created. Please take a look.
